## Quick Start

- The menu at the left can be used to move between the various control sections – Mixer, Velocity, Expression, etc.
- When you move a knob or slider with your mouse its value will be displayed.
- Hold down ctrl or cmd to increase precision when you move a knob or slider.
- You can double click a knob or slider to reset it to its default value.
- If you hold the shift key while clicking on a knob or slider an input box will be displayed where you can enter a specific value.

## Automation

Most of the sliders and knobs on the interface can be controlled with a continuous controller.

You can assign a hardware controller to a control using MIDI learn: just right-click a control, select MIDI learn, and move a hardware knob, wheel, or fader to assign its MIDI controller number to that control. You can right-click the control again to remove the assignment.

Many of the on-screen controls will respond to automation within your DAW without needing to assign a CC to them first. Check your DAW’s user guide for details on how to access automatable parameters.

## Keyboard
- The playable range of the currently loaded instrument is illuminated on the keyboard.
- Grey keys are outside of the playable range and produce no sound.
- Key switches (used for changing articulation) are coloured red and will always be positioned outside of the instrument’s playable range.
