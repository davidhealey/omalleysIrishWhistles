Tin whistle, penny whistle, English flageolet, tin flageolet, Belfast Hornpipe, feadóg stáin, and of course Irish whistle are just some of the many names given to the traditional Celtic fipple flutes.

O’Malley’s Irish Whistles includes D, C, Bb, and Low D whistle sample sets.

This library was recorded in the same studio as Michaela’s Harp.
