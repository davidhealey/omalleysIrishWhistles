You access the preset browser by clicking the name of the currently loaded preset which is displayed on the main interface. The arrow buttons on either side can be used to load the previous or next preset.

The browser itself is divided into two columns allowing you to select a preset based on the type of whistle.

The plugin includes a selection of default presets which you can customize and you can also create your own.

## Filtering

You can filter the list of presets by typing in the search bar at the top of the preset browser and hitting enter.

Clicking the star icon next to a preset will add it to your favourites list, clicking it again will remove it from your favourites. You can see all your favourites by clicking the larger star icon next to the search box.

## Adding and Editing Presets

Click the Add button beneath the appropriate column to add new categories, banks, or presets. You can use the Delete and Rename buttons to edit existing entries.

You can save any changes youâ€™ve made to an existing preset by clicking the Save Preset button next to the search bar.

Adding or saving a preset stores the state of the controls on the interface as well as the currently loaded samples.

## Import and Export

Clicking the More button will open a drop down menu offering you a number of options for importing and exporting your presets.
