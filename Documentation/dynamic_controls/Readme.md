## Velocity
When using the Live articulation the note-on velocity controls the attack of each note. Playing a low velocity will create a longer attack and a high velocity will produce a shorter attack.

Velocity can also be used to control the initial Dynamic of a note. To activate this functionality you need to enable the small round button next to the Dynamics knob. This will cause the Velocity Control button to be displayed which you can then activate.

## Expression
The expression control provides an overall volume change to the instrument. This can be used in conjunction with the dynamics controller to customise the dynamic range of the instrument or create niente diminuendos.

## Dynamics
The dynamics controller allows you to smoothly change the instrument’s dynamic. A volume change is also applied automatically by this controller to keep the dynamics consistent and realistic across the range of the instrument. Like all fipple flutes the playable dynamics of the Irish Whistle are limited and vary across the range of the instrument, generally low notes are soft and high notes are loud.

## Vibrato
The vibrato intensity knob controls the amount of vibrato. The vibrato rate knob controls the speed of the vibrato. A lower value will produce a slower vibrato while a higher value creates a faster vibrato

## Pitch Bend
All of the whistles in this library respond to the pitch bend controller. This is a great way to play simple slides into and out of notes in real-time.

## Response Curves
Next to each performance control knob is a small button which when enabled will display the response curve for that control. If none of the buttons are enabled the response curve for velocity will be displayed.

You can edit the response curve to adjust the control’s sensitivity.

- Move a node by clicking on it and dragging.
- Add a new node by clicking anywhere along the curve that doesn’t already have a node.
- Delete a node by right clicking it.
- Edit the curve between two nodes by hovering your mouse cursor over a node and moving the scroll wheel up or down.

## Master Output

The master output controls allow you to adjust the sound of the instrument after any sonic changes created by the other controls.

- Pan: This controls the left/right balance of the instrument.
- Volume: Provides the final stage of the instrument’s volume control. It can also provide a gain boost of up to +3dB at its highest setting.
- Coarse: tune Tuning control in the range of -12 to +12 semitones.
- Fine tune: Tuning control in the range of -100 to +100 cents.
